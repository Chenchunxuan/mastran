matlab/octave toolset for msc nastran bdf manipulation

- Predominantly exists to formalize things like regular expressions and data structure formats

- In stark contrast to PyNastran, this aims to be almost exclusively a command line based tool.
Highlights of this toolset are vectorized bdf reading and writing script fragments, as well as
elementary tools for bdf modification, assembly, and visualization.
